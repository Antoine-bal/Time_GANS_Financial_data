# Time_GANS_Financial_data
Time Series Generative Adversarial Networks calibration for financial time series.
The main objective of the project is to be able to generate synthetic returns of time series using an unsupervised Deep Learning Structure, TGANS, derivated from the widely-used GANs model developed in 2014 by "Ian Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron Courville, and Yoshua Bengio. Generative adversarial nets. Advances in neural information processing systems, 27, 2014".

We calibrate a multi-asset, multi-dimensional TGANs with the aim to statistically produce a relevant synthetic dataset that can be used in other Risk Management use cases such as VaR calibration.
